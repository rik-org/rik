# Riklet 

[Rust in Kube (RIK)](https://github.com/dev-sys-do/rik) node agent

## Dependencies

To work, Riklet requires the following packages : 

- [Runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) : to run containers
- [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) : to pull containers images from multiples sources.
- [Umoci](https://github.com/opencontainers/umoci) : to unpack & modifies OCI images.

## Concept

The **riklet** is the primary node agent that runs on each node.

It is responsible to interpret scheduling instructions and run workloads.

Also, it is able to send metrics about node and pods regularly to the scheduler.

## Usage

**To run the Riklet, you must have setup previously your RIK master node and get it's IP address.**

```bash
riklet --master-ip <YOUR_IP>:<PORT>
```

To run riklet as root with **cargo**:
        
```bash
CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_RUNNER='sudo -E' cargo run --bin riklet
```

You should see something like that : 

```
