# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation of the project RIK, we hope you will enjoy your 
journey here. In case of mistakes or typos, please open an issue or a pull
request on the GitHub repository.

## What is RIK ?

RIK is a lightweight cloud orchestrator written in Rust. It is **not designed**
to be used in **production**, but rather as a learning tool for people who want
to learn about cloud computing and distributed systems.

This project was initially started as a school project, however it continued
to be improved throughout time. It is currently being used in a larger project
as a FaaS orchestrator.

## What is the goal ?

The goal of this project is to provide a simple and lightweight orchestrator
in Rust. It doesn't have an end goal, feel free to help us improving this
project.

## Who are we ?

We are a group of French students who are passionate about cloud computing and
distributed systems. We are currently studying at 
[Polytech Montpellier](https://www.polytech.umontpellier.fr/). We started this
project in order to improve our skills in Rust, and to implement a complete
architecture. It might not be perfect, however we tried to answer as good as 
we could to the requirements of a cloud orchestrator.
